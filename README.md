# Loan Default Prediction

For this project I will be exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. We will try to create a model that will help predict this.

I'll use lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. The dataset is available here.

### Here are what the columns represent:

1. credit.policy: 1 if the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com, and 0 otherwise.
2. The purpose of the loan (takes values "credit_card", "debt_consolidation", "educational", "major_purchase",        "small_business", and "all_other").
